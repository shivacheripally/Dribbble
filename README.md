This is a React project showcasing a company profile application hosted on Netlify. The application includes various components such as a navbar, header, animation, and footer. It utilizes Tailwind CSS or Tailwind UI components for styling.

## Live Demo

A live demo of the application can be accessed at: [Company Profile App](https://646ebf6f30dd6c55975cc539--heartfelt-belekoy-8e4225.netlify.app/)

## Features

### Navbar

The navbar component serves as a visual showcase and does not include any implemented routes or functional buttons. It demonstrates the usage of Tailwind CSS or Tailwind UI components. You can easily customize the navbar by modifying the relevant components and styles according to your project requirements.

### Header

The header section of the application contains the company profile. It provides an overview of the company and its key details. When a user clicks on the header, a new component named `Animation.js` is displayed below it. This interactive behavior enhances user engagement and allows for a dynamic user experience.

### Animation

The `Animation.js` component features four images, each representing a distinct animation. When a user clicks on any of the images, the selected image is displayed in an enlarged format above the `Animation` component. Additionally, relevant information such as the author, number of likes, and views for each animation is displayed. Please note that the likes functionality is currently not implemented, but it can be easily integrated by updating the application's state management.

The `Animation.js` component demonstrates the use of React's component-based architecture and showcases the seamless integration of images and data. You can extend this component by adding more animations and enhancing the user interaction based on your project requirements.

### Footer

The footer component displays further company details and provides additional links for more information. It is designed to offer users quick access to relevant resources and additional content. However, please note that the links are currently non-interactive and serve a visual purpose only. You can easily update the footer component to include functional links that redirect users to specific pages or external websites.
